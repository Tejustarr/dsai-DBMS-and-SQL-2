## Task: Advanced Joins Practice

1. Use lab_setup.sql to create DB with employees, departments, projects, and salary_grades.
2. Write queries to:
   - List employees with department names, including employees without departments.
   - List all departments and the number of employees in each (include empty departments).
   - List employees with their salary grade using salary_grades table.
   - Perform a CROSS JOIN between departments and projects.
   - Create a report showing employee name, department name, project name (multi-join).

## Deliverables
- SQL scripts with queries and results.
- Report explaining join choices.
