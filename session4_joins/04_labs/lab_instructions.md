# Lab - Session 4

## Objective
Practice joining tables: inner, outer, natural, equi, non-equi, and cross joins.

## Steps
1. Run `lab_setup.sql` to create `session4_lab.db`.
2. Open `lab.ipynb` to run sample join queries.
3. Modify queries to test different join conditions and explore NULL handling.
