# Lab - Session 6

## Objective
Practice window functions, recursive queries, and constraints.

## Steps
1. Run `lab_setup.sql` to create `session6_lab.db`.
2. Open `lab.ipynb` in Jupyter.
3. Execute sample window functions (RANK, NTILE, etc.).
4. Try recursive queries.
5. Explore integrity constraints by inserting invalid data.
